# Runner

Runner is a game by Kyle MacFarland written in C for the Nintendo Entertainment System.


## Why?

I wanted to make a game for the original Nintendo to learn more about low-level software development. Also, knowing about the limitations of retro game consoles gives you an appreciation for games made for those systems.

The decision to use C was made to speed up development time.


## How do I play it?

Download the runner.nes rom file. Open it with your NES emulator of choice and enjoy! ([FCEUX](https://fceux.com/web/home.html) and [Nestopia UE](http://0ldsk00l.ca/nestopia/) are both good emulators if you're new to this.)
